# ProxyDevTools
A collection of developer tools to make my life easier, some ported from 2Ship some created for Recomp.

All features are off by default, and need to be enabled in the Configuration menu.

## Features:
- Hold L to levitate
- Inventory Editor - Press L on the pause menu to enable editing of the inventory, then press A to grant/remove an item
- Map Select - L + R + Z Brings you to a map select screen, allowing you to warp to various scenes/entrances/cutscenes
- Debug Save - New files created with 100% of the inventory filled
- No Clip - Ported from OoT Debug mode, Hold L and press D-pad right to activate

## Planned:
- Warp Point - Ability to set a warp point anywhere in the game and return there at the press of a button.
- Inventory Editor Tweaks - Awaiting more modding UI capabilities
